### 📌 Project Title  

## Turbocharger Vibration Prediction using XGBoost-SVR Hybrid Model

This project applies a hybrid XGBoost + SVR approach to predict maximum vibration amplitudes in turbocharger systems using engineered features from operational and structural data.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Hybrid model combining XGBoost and SVR
- Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering
- Performance evaluation with MSE, MAE, and R²
- Visualization of model predictions vs actual values

## 📊 Dataset

Structured vibration data containing features such as:

- Excitation Order (I)
- Mode (L)
- Node Diameter (K)
- Frequency (J)
- Nominal Amplitude (N)
- Sensor values like pressure and temperature readings

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- ML Technqiues like XGBoost, SVR, RF, DT
- AI Technquies like NN, RNN, GRU, LSTM
- scikit-learn, pyTorch
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📈 Results
- Best MSE: ~9.68 on unseen data
- Hybrid model captures critical features and residuals better than deep learning models
